                <p><h2>Welcome to Dog Shop online! Your favorite dog store!</h2></p>
                <br>
                <p>Dog Shop started in 2001 when our owner, Jack, decided to create a chain of stores just for dogs. He realized that just about every family in his town owned a dog and figured the closer a dog store was to your home, the better care your dog would be in.</p>
                <p>No one wants to travel more than a couple miles to go to the grocery store, so why travel more than a couple miles to the dog store! Dog Shop is currently expanding to make sure that your dog care is about of your weekly routine.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Dog Shop currently has 3 locations in Fresno and Clovis, but will double by the end of 2018. Making dog care easier and fun for evryone in the family. Dog Shop is focused on keeping on the best products on our shelves. All of our products are throughly reviewed before put on the shelves to ensure your dog is recieving the best quality.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>LOCAL! LOCAL! LOCAL!</strong></p>
                <p>Dog Shop is proud to sell locally made dog treats, leashes, collars, and toys! Visit a location today to checkout of some of the Central Valley's greatest products.</p>
